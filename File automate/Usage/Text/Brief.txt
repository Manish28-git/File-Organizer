Brief Explanation of the Program
This program is a Python-based file organizer designed to automate the process of categorizing and managing files in a specified directory. Additionally, it incorporates a disk usage optimization feature to monitor and manage storage space efficiently. Here's a concise breakdown of how it works:

1. Purpose
File Organization: Automatically moves files into categorized folders (e.g., Excel, Music, Docs) based on their file types.
Disk Usage Optimization: Monitors folder sizes, archives older files, and deletes large files to ensure efficient disk space utilization.
2. Core Features
File Categorization:

Detects files in a specified directory.
Moves files into predefined folders (Excel, Music, Image, Docs, and Text) based on their extensions.
Folder Creation:

Checks if categorized folders exist; creates them if they don't.
Disk Usage Monitoring:

Calculates the size of each categorized folder.
Compares folder sizes against a specified size limit (500 MB in this case).
Disk Optimization:

Archiving: Moves files older than 30 days into an "Archive" subfolder.
Deletion: Removes files larger than 50 MB to free up space.
Continuous Operation:

Runs in a loop, performing the organization and optimization every 24 hours.
3. How It Works
Directory Scanning:

The program scans the specified directory (M:/Python24/File automate/Usage/) for files and folders.
Categorization:

Files are checked for their extensions and moved to corresponding folders (Excel, Music, etc.).
Disk Usage Check:

The program calculates folder sizes using the os module.
If a folder exceeds the defined size limit, it triggers optimization.
Optimization:

Archiving: Files older than 30 days are moved to an "Archive" folder.
Deletion: Files exceeding 50 MB are deleted to free up space.
Continuous Execution:

After organizing files and optimizing disk usage, the program pauses for 24 hours before running again.
4. Libraries Used
os: For file and directory operations.
shutil: For moving files and folders.
time: For calculating file age and scheduling periodic runs.
5. Code Structure
Helper Functions:
get_folder_size(): Calculates the size of a folder.
handle_exceeding_folder(): Archives or deletes files in folders exceeding size limits.
Main Functionality:
organize_files(): Categorizes files and invokes disk usage checks.
check_disk_usage(): Checks folder sizes and triggers optimization.
Loop:
A while True loop ensures the script runs continuously every 24 hours.
6. Example Workflow
A folder contains mixed files: report.xlsx, song.mp3, photo.jpg, and large_video.mp4.
The program:
Moves report.xlsx to the Excel folder.
Moves song.mp3 to the Music folder.
Moves photo.jpg to the Image folder.
If the Music folder exceeds 500 MB:
Archives songs older than 30 days.
Deletes large files exceeding 50 MB.
7. Key Benefits
Automates manual file organization.
Prevents folders from becoming cluttered.
Ensures efficient use of disk space by removing unnecessary files.
Reduces user effort with continuous execution.
